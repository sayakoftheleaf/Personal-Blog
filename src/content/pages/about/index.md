Hello stranger. This is my blog, me being Sayak (Sha-yok NOT sa-yak) or Rick,
however you know me. I am a software developer, student, vlogger, wannable
artist/writer/filmmaker. Yeah, that's a lot of things, I know, and I am a
n00b at almost all of them (Even at being a student, somehow). But I try, and
this blog is an extension of that. Feel free to have a look around, I try and
deliver things that I think might be useful to some people.

If you want to get in touch with me, I am just an email away - theotherrick@pm.me
